# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: windows-latest
  name: Azure Pipelines
  demands:

  lfs: true  # whether to download Git-LFS files
  submodules: true | recursive  # set to 'true' for a single level of submodules or 'recursive' to get submodules of submodules
  path: buildxl_Test  # path to check out source code, relative to the agent's build directory (e.g. \_work\1)
  persistCredentials: true  # set to 'true' to leave the OAuth token in the Git config after the initial fetch
